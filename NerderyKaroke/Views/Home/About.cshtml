    I hope you enjoy the site. Though since I threw it together so very hastily, there are bound to be issues. <br />
    If you notice something unusual or out of place drop me a <a href="mailto:ahofer@nerdery.com" target="_top">line</a>. I'll berate you a little bit, but then calm down and probably be very grateful.
